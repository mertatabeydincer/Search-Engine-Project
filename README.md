# Search-Engine-Project
CS 300 Project 

The search engines in real life, search hundreds of millions web pages to see if they have the words that you have typed, and they can do this for thousands of users at a given time. In order to do these searches really fast, search engines such as Google do a lot of what we call preprocessing of the pages they search; that is, they transform the contents of a web page (which for the purposes of this project, we will assume to consist of only strings) into a structure that can be searched very fast.
